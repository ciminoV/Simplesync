# Simplesync

Python scripts to sync local notes written in markdown with Simplenote app.

Dependencies:
[Python library for the simplenote web service](https://github.com/simplenote-vim/simplenote.py)


## TODO:

- Add a command-line interface 
- Organize the project code base

## BUGS:

- Creating a local note with a title different from the first line, will cause the syncing from remote to create a new local note.
